## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**If chatbot gives generic responses:**
- Make sure `START_ML_CHATBOT.bat` is running
- Check http://localhost:5000/health shows data loaded
- Restart website (`START_WEBSITE.bat`)

**If website won't start:**
- Close all PowerShell/CMD windows
- Run `npx kill-port 3001` in terminal
- Try `START_WEBSITE.bat` again

**If ML chatbot won't start:**
- Check datasets exist in `ml-chatbot/models/`
- Verify Python virtual environment: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe`
